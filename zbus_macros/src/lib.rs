/// Attribute macro for defining D-Bus proxies (using [`zbus::Proxy`] and
/// [`zbus::blocking::Proxy`]).
///
/// The macro must be applied on a `trait T`. Two matching `impl T` will provide an asynchronous
/// Proxy implementation, named `TraitNameProxy` and a blocking one, named `TraitNameProxyBlocking`.
/// The proxy instances can be created with the associated `new()` or `builder()` methods. The
/// former doesn't take any argument and uses the default service name and path. The later allows
/// you to specify non-default proxy arguments.
///
/// The following attributes are supported:
///
/// * `interface` - the name of the D-Bus interface this proxy is for.
///
/// * `default_service` - the default service this proxy should connect to.
///
/// * `default_path` - The default object path the method calls will be sent on and signals will be
///   sent for by the target service.
///
/// * `gen_async` - Whether or not to generate the asynchronous Proxy type.
///
/// * `gen_blocking` - Whether or not to generate the blocking Proxy type. If the `blocking-api`
///   cargo feature is disabled, this attribute is ignored and blocking Proxy type is not generated.
///
/// * `async_name` - Specify the exact name of the asynchronous proxy type.
///
/// * `blocking_name` - Specify the exact name of the blocking proxy type.
///
/// * `assume_defaults` - whether to auto-generate values for `default_path` and `default_service`
///   if none are specified (default: `false`). `proxy` generates a warning if neither this
///   attribute nor one of the default values are specified. Please make sure to explicitly set
///   either this attribute or the default values, according to your needs.
///
/// Each trait method will be expanded to call to the associated D-Bus remote interface.
///
/// Trait methods accept `proxy` attributes:
///
/// * `name` - override the D-Bus name (pascal case form by default)
///
/// * `property` - expose the method as a property. If the method takes an argument, it must be a
///   setter, with a `set_` prefix. Otherwise, it's a getter. Additional sub-attributes exists to
///   control specific property behaviors:
///   * `emits_changed_signal` - specifies how property changes are signaled. Valid values are those
///     documented in [DBus specifications][dbus_emits_changed_signal]:
///     * `"true"` - (default) change signal is always emitted with the value included. This uses
///       the default caching behavior of the proxy, and generates a listener method for the change
///       signal.
///     * `"invalidates"` - change signal is emitted, but the value is not included in the signal.
///       This has the same behavior as `"true"`.
///     * `"const"` - property never changes, thus no signal is ever emitted for it. This uses the
///       default caching behavior of the proxy, but does not generate a listener method for the
///       change signal.
///     * `"false"` - change signal is not (guaranteed to be) emitted if the property changes. This
///       disables property value caching, and does not generate a listener method for the change
///       signal.
///
/// * `signal` - declare a signal just like a D-Bus method. Read the [Signals](#signals) section
///   below for details.
///
/// * `no_reply` - declare a method call that does not wait for a reply.
///
/// * `no_autostart` - declare a method call that will not trigger the bus to automatically launch
///   the destination service if it is not already running.
///
/// * `allow_interactive_auth` - declare a method call that is allowed to trigger an interactive
///   prompt for authorization or confirmation from the receiver.
///
/// * `object` - methods that returns an [`ObjectPath`] can be annotated with the `object` attribute
///   to specify the proxy object to be constructed from the returned [`ObjectPath`].
///
/// * `async_object` - if the assumptions made by `object` attribute about naming of the
///   asynchronous proxy type, don't fit your bill, you can use this to specify its exact name.
///
/// * `blocking_object` - if the assumptions made by `object` attribute about naming of the blocking
///   proxy type, don't fit your bill, you can use this to specify its exact name.
///
///   NB: Any doc comments provided shall be appended to the ones added by the macro.
///
/// # Signals
///
/// For each signal method declared, this macro will provide a method, named `receive_<method_name>`
/// to create a [`zbus::SignalStream`] ([`zbus::blocking::SignalIterator`] for the blocking proxy)
/// wrapper, named `<SignalName>Stream` (`<SignalName>Iterator` for the blocking proxy) that yield
/// a [`zbus::message::Message`] wrapper, named `<SignalName>`. This wrapper provides type safe
/// access to the signal arguments. It also implements `Deref<Target = Message>` to allow easy
/// access to the underlying [`zbus::message::Message`].
///
/// For each property with `emits_changed_signal` set to `"true"` (default) or `"invalidates"`,
/// this macro will provide a method named `receive_<property_name>_changed` that creates a
/// [`zbus::proxy::PropertyStream`] for the property.
///

/// Attribute macro for implementing a D-Bus interface.
///
/// The macro must be applied on an `impl T`. All methods will be exported, either as methods,
/// properties or signal depending on the item attributes. It will implement the [`Interface`] trait
/// `for T` on your behalf, to handle the message dispatching and introspection support.
///
/// The trait accepts the `interface` attributes:
///
/// * `name` - the D-Bus interface name
///
/// * `spawn` - Controls the spawning of tasks for method calls. By default, `true`, allowing zbus
///   to spawn a separate task for each method call. This default behavior can lead to methods being
///   handled out of their received order, which might not always align with expected or desired
///   behavior.
///
///   - **When True (Default):** Suitable for interfaces where method calls are independent of each
///     other or can be processed asynchronously without strict ordering. In scenarios where a
///     client must wait for a reply before making further dependent calls, this default behavior is
///     appropriate.
///
///   - **When False:** Use this setting to ensure methods are handled in the order they are
///     received, which is crucial for interfaces requiring sequential processing of method calls.
///     However, care must be taken to avoid making D-Bus method calls from within your interface
///     methods when this setting is false, as it may lead to deadlocks under certain conditions.
///
/// * `proxy` - If specified, a proxy type will also be generated for the interface. This attribute
///   supports all the [`macro@proxy`]-specific sub-attributes (e.g `gen_async`). The common
///   sub-attributes (e.g `name`) are automatically forwarded to the [`macro@proxy`] macro.
///
/// * `introspection_docs` - whether to include the documentation in the introspection data
///   (Default: `true`). If your interface is well-known or well-documented, you may want to set
///   this to `false` to reduce the the size of your binary and D-Bus traffic.
///
/// The methods accepts the `interface` attributes:
///
/// * `name` - override the D-Bus name (pascal case form of the method by default)
///
/// * `property` - expose the method as a property. If the method takes an argument, it must be a
///   setter, with a `set_` prefix. Otherwise, it's a getter. If it may fail, a property method must
///   return `zbus::fdo::Result`. An additional sub-attribute exists to control the emission of
///   signals on changes to the property:
///   * `emits_changed_signal` - specifies how property changes are signaled. Valid values are those
///     documented in [DBus specifications][dbus_emits_changed_signal]:
///     * `"true"` - (default) the change signal is always emitted when the property's setter is
///       called. The value of the property is included in the signal.
///     * `"invalidates"` - the change signal is emitted, but the value is not included in the
///       signal.
///     * `"const"` - the property never changes, thus no signal is ever emitted for it.
///     * `"false"` - the change signal is not emitted if the property changes. If a property is
///       write-only, the change signal will not be emitted in this interface.
///
/// * `signal` - the method is a "signal". It must be a method declaration (without body). Its code
///   block will be expanded to emit the signal from the object path associated with the interface
///   instance. Moreover, `interface` will also generate a trait named `<Interface>Signals` that
///   provides all the signal methods but without the `SignalEmitter` argument. The macro implements
///   this trait for two types, `zbus::object_server::InterfaceRef<Interface>` and
///   `SignalEmitter<'_>`. The former is useful for emitting signals from outside the context of an
///   interface method and the latter is useful for emitting signals from inside interface methods.
///
///   You can call a signal method from a an interface method, or from an [`ObjectServer::with`]
///   function.
///
/// * `out_args` - When returning multiple values from a method, naming the out arguments become
///   important. You can use `out_args` to specify their names.
///
/// * `proxy` - Use this to specify the [`macro@proxy`]-specific method sub-attributes (e.g
///   `object`). The common sub-attributes (e.g `name`) are automatically forworded to the
///   [`macro@proxy`] macro. Moreover, you can use `visibility` sub-attribute to specify the
///   visibility of the generated proxy type(s).
///
///   In such case, your method must return a tuple containing
///   your out arguments, in the same order as passed to `out_args`.
///
/// The `struct_return` attribute (from zbus 1.x) is no longer supported. If you want to return a
/// single structure from a method, declare it to return a tuple containing either a named structure
/// or a nested tuple.
///
/// Note: a `<property_name_in_snake_case>_changed` method is generated for each property: this
/// method emits the "PropertiesChanged" signal for the associated property. The setter (if it
/// exists) will automatically call this method. For instance, a property setter named `set_foo`
/// will be called to set the property "Foo", and will emit the "PropertiesChanged" signal with the
/// new value for "Foo". Other changes to the "Foo" property can be signaled manually with the
/// generated `foo_changed` method. In addition, a `<property_name_in_snake_case>_invalidated`
/// method is also generated that much like `_changed` method, emits a "PropertyChanged" signal
/// but does not send over the new value of the property along with it. It is usually best to avoid
/// using this since it will force all interested peers to fetch the new value and hence result in
/// excess traffic on the bus.
///
/// The method arguments support the following `zbus` attributes:
///
/// * `object_server` - This marks the method argument to receive a reference to the
///   [`ObjectServer`] this method was called by.
/// * `connection` - This marks the method argument to receive a reference to the [`Connection`] on
///   which the method call was received.
/// * `header` - This marks the method argument to receive the message header associated with the
///   D-Bus method call being handled. For property methods, this will be an `Option<Header<'_>>`,
///   which will be set to `None` if the method is called for reasons other than to respond to an
///   external property access.
/// * `signal_emitter` - This marks the method argument to receive a [`SignalEmitter`] instance,
///   which is needed for emitting signals the easy way.
