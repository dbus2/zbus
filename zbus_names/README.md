This crate provides collection of types for various [D-Bus bus names][dbn].

This is used by [`zbus`] (and in future by [`zbus_macros`] as well) crate. Other D-Bus crates are also
encouraged to use this API in the spirit of cooperation. :)

For convenience, `zbus` re-exports this crate as `names`, so you do not need to depend directly on
this crate if you already depend on `zbus`.

**Status:** Stable.
