# Establishing a connection

The first thing you will have to do is to connect to a D-Bus bus or to a D-Bus peer. This is the
entry point of the zbus API.

## Connection to the bus

To connect to the session bus (the *per-user* bus), simply call `Connection::session()`. It
returns an instance of the connection (if all went well).

Similarly, to connect to the system bus (to communicate with services such as [NetworkManager],
[BlueZ] or [PID1]), use `Connection::system()`.

**Note:** it is common for a D-Bus library to provide a "shared" connection to a bus for a process:
all `session()` share the same underlying connection for example. At the time of this writing,
zbus doesn't do that.

## Using a custom bus address

You may also specify a custom bus with `Connection::new_for_address()` which takes a D-Bus address
[as specified in the
specification](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#addresses).

## Peer to peer connection

Peer-to-peer connections are bus-less[^bus-less], and the initial handshake protocol is a bit
different. There is the notion of client & server endpoints, but that distinction doesn't matter
once the connection is established (both ends are equal, and can send any messages).

To create a bus-less peer-to-peer connection on Unix, you can make a `socketpair()` (or have a
listening socket server, accepting multiple connections), and hand over the socket FDs to
`Connection::new_unix_server` and `Connection::new_unix_client` for each side. After success, you
can call the `Connection` methods to send and receive messages on both ends.

See the `unix_p2p` test in the [zbus source code] for a simple example.

[^bus-less] Unless you implemented them, none of the bus methods will exist.
