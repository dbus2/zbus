# Fails if any crate zbus's runtimes do not need shows up as a normal dependency of zbus, in
# whichever feature set the caller passes through. zruntime is a task scheduler and poll(2)-based
# reactor of its own: no build of zbus should link async-io, async-executor, async-task, blocking
# or their private dependencies as a normal dependency, whether the default-rt feature, the tokio
# feature, both or neither is on (`-e normal` already excludes dev-dependencies, so the test
# suite's own use of async-io does not trip this). zbus builds its notifications on zruntime's
# `Event`, and gets its async locks (where Tokio's do not stand in), broadcast channels and the
# thread its default blocking-work hook runs on from zruntime too, so every tree with the `comms`
# feature has the `zruntime` crate in it, with its `event`, `lock`, `broadcast` and `unblock`
# features always, its `runtime`, `helper`, `tcp`, `unix` and `process` features only where zbus's
# `default-rt` feature is on and its `tracing` feature only where zbus's `tracing` is; it is
# expected there rather than being on the forbidden list. So is `signal-hook-registry`, which
# Tokio's `process` feature adds in the builds with the `tokio` feature and a transport that runs
# a program (`unixexec`, `ibus`, or macOS, where `launchd:` does).
#
# Usage: forbidden-deps.sh <label> [cargo tree arguments...]
#
# <label> names the build being checked, for the failure message (e.g. "default",
# "tokio-only", "external-only"). Everything after it is passed straight to `cargo tree`, e.g.:
#   CI/forbidden-deps.sh tokio-only --no-default-features --features tokio,proxy,service
#
# The tree is written out before it is searched, so that a `cargo tree` failure fails the job
# instead of handing grep an empty stream. A `cargo tree` line is a prefix of box-drawing
# characters, the crate name and its version, so matching from the start of the line up to the
# version is what keeps a crate whose name merely contains one of these from counting.
