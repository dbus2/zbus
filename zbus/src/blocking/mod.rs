//! The blocking API.
//!
//! This module hosts all our blocking API. All the types under this module are thin wrappers
//! around the corresponding asynchronous types. Most of the method calls are simply calling their
//! asynchronous counterparts on the underlying types and use [`async_io::block_on`] to turn them
//! into blocking calls.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! Since methods provided by these types run their own little runtime (`block_on`), you must not
//! use them in async contexts because of the infamous [async sandwich footgun][asf]. This is
//! an especially important fact to keep in mind for [`crate::interface`]. While `interface` allows
//! non-async methods for convenience, these methods are called from an async context. The
//! [`blocking` crate] provides an easy way around this problem though.
//!
