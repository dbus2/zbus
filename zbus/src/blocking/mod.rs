//! The blocking API.
//!
//! This module hosts all our blocking API. All the types under this module are thin wrappers
//! around the corresponding asynchronous types. Most of the method calls are simply calling their
//! asynchronous counterparts on the underlying types and use [`async_io::block_on`] to turn them
//! into blocking calls.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! Since methods provided by these types run their own little runtime (`block_on`), you must not
//! call by them from async contexts because of the infamous [async sandwich footgun][asf]. This is
//! is an especially important fact to keep in mind for [`crate::dbus_interface`]. While
//! `dbus_interface` allows non-async methods for convenience, these methods are called from an
//! async context.
