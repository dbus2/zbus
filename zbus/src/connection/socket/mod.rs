///
/// In order to allow simultaneous reading and writing, this trait requires you to split the socket
/// into a read half and a write half. The reader and writer halves can be any types that implement
/// [`ReadHalf`] and [`WriteHalf`] respectively.
///
/// The crate provides implementations for `async_io` and `tokio`'s `UnixStream` wrappers if you
/// enable the corresponding crate features (`async_io` is enabled by default).
///
/// You can implement it manually to integrate with other runtimes or other dbus transports.  Feel
/// free to submit pull requests to add support for more runtimes to zbus itself so rust's orphan
/// rules don't force the use of a wrapper struct (and to avoid duplicating the work across many
