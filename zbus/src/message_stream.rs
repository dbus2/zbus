    /// match rules registered by the destination) by the bus. Hence there is no need to register
    /// match rules for non-signal messages with the bus.

    /// Having said that, stream created by this method can still very useful as it allows you to
    /// avoid needless task wakeups and simplify your stream consuming code.
