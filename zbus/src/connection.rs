/// A D-Bus connection.
///
/// A connection to a D-Bus bus, or a direct peer.
///
/// Once created, the connection is authenticated and negotiated and messages can be sent or
/// received, such as [method calls] or [signals].
///
/// For higher-level message handling (typed functions, introspection, documentation reasons etc),
/// it is recommended to wrap the low-level D-Bus messages into Rust functions with the
/// [`dbus_proxy`] and [`dbus_interface`] macros instead of doing it directly on a `Connection`.
///
/// Typically, a connection is made to the session bus with [`new_session`], or to the system bus
/// with [`new_system`]. Then the connection is shared with the [`Proxy`] and [`ObjectServer`]
/// instances.
///
/// `Connection` implements [`Clone`] and cloning it is a very cheap operation, as the underlying
/// data is not cloned. This makes it very convenient to share the connection between different
/// parts of your code. `Connection` also implements [`std::marker::Sync`] and[`std::marker::Send`]
/// so you can send and share a connection instance across threads as well.
///
/// Since there are times when important messages arrive between a method call message is sent and
/// its reply is received, `Connection` keeps an internal queue of incoming messages so that these
/// messages are not lost and subsequent calls to [`receive_message`] will retreive messages from
/// this queue first. The size of this queue is configurable through the [`set_max_queued`] method.
/// The default size is 64. When the queue is full, messages are dropped to create room, starting
/// from the oldest one.
